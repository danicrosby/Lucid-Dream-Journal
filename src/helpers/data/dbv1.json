      "entry" : "There was something about starting out and a hair salon? Maybe my moms hair salon? Maybe in Macon? But at the same time it was a different town but familiar. I was on a lunch break from crossroads pet professional a kennel that I used to work for last year. I only had an hour but it seemed as though I was gone a lot longer. And can’t I explain what I was doing. I was dodging my manager who happened to come into the store on her lunch break. I don’t think she was necessarily looking for me but I hit behind stalls to avoid her. This actually happened in real life in a Walgreens the other day but I was not working that day or I was not working at that job anymore. But I did not want to talk to her at the time. So I had from his from her and checked out as fast as I could. I did some more shopping at various stores that I cannot remember. Then this happened:\n\nJon receives call fro my cousin Bryon. Looks shocked and sad stars to cry. Hands me phone. Bryon says his day (my uncle) Larry has died. My mom (Who has been dead for over 10 years) is standing there too. I ask if I should tell her. He says no! I ask again, he says no- that Gale was going to tell her ( I don’t  know who Gale is.) I go to the back of the store and ask him in private why. He said something I can’t remember but I didn’t agree with him about telling her. He again said do not tell her to Gale was going to tell her. So I go back out to the store front and go ahead and tell her. She is upset but not too upset because we all knew he was sick. She said she already knew that was going to happen.\n\nThe next part of my dream was about being at my house in Walnut Creek. Morning that there was a creek or river behind our house. It was a Walnut Creek. There were a lot of people swimming in it. I had a lot of friends over, some of which I did not know. Some of which I didn’t know but I didn’t at the same time. There was a woman there from my class, Marcel, it was her but it was not at the same time. I felt the need to entertain everyone although I did not want to. I plunged into the river. The water was dark and dirty, there was lots of sand and there was lots of mud along the bank. I let whoever know that I had no idea that there was a river behind our house and that we had lived there for 15 years. This person was my exes girlfriend. She seems nice enough and asked me a lot questions About a side effect I cannot remember. But I felt as if she would ask me about dating Josh at some point, but she never did. In the dream later John comes up to me and is looking really sexy. He grabbed me by the Waist and draws me close. I could tell that you wanted to make out there were people around including my mom. It was teasing the idea of making out with me over and over throughout the next half hour. It was driving me crazy. I really want to make out. I kept getting pulled in and out of trying to entertain people and trying to make this person Marcel. happy. In real life Marcel and explain to me that she did not like it when people or flaky around her. So I felt the need to make sure I was there for her when she had anything to say at all. But all I could think about was making out with John. Finally, we find a spot to start kissing. And that is all I remember\n\n*** Follow up. I just got a text from my cousin Brian he said his dad is coming out today for a quick visit. He fears this may be his last trip. And asked if I wanted to come and see him one last time. This is out of the blue and I have not seen my uncle for several months. He was not on my mind other than the dream I had just had last night. I asked him who Gale was, initially he said he didn’t know. Then we both remembered that Gale is actually my mother’s other brother’s middle name who coincidentally has passed away as well.",
