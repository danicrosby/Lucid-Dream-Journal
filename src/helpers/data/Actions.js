  Sleeping: 'peace of mind. Alternatively, it means that you are ignorant of the conditions and circumstances around you. If you dream of sleeping together with someone (in a non-sexual manner), then it suggests that you are avoiding some issue or situation that is being symbolized by the person. If you do not know this person, then it indicates that you are refusing to recognize a negative or hidden aspect of yourself. Sleeping may also be synonymous with death in that it beckons renewal and new beginnings. To see someone sleeping in your dream is a reflection of yourself and your own subconscious mind. It is telling you that you may not be alert or informed about a particular situation. More specifically, to see your parent(s) sleeping implies that you are turning a blind eye to certain things that would normally bother you. To see your boyfriend sleeping in your dream indicates that you are refusing to see a problem in the relationship. You are afraid to confront or bring up the issue.',
  Running: 'you are avoiding some issues in your waking life. The actions in your dream exemplify how you respond to pressure and cope with fears, stress or various situations. Instead of confronting the situation, you have a tendency to run away and avoid issues that you are uncomfortable with addressing',
  Chased: 'you are avoiding some issues in your waking life. The actions in your dream exemplify how you respond to pressure and cope with fears, stress or various situations. Instead of confronting the situation, you have a tendency to run away and avoid issues that you are uncomfortable with addressing',
  Falling: 'you have no control and have nothing to hold on to. Thus your falling dream is analogous to a situation in your waking life where you are lacking or losing control. You are feeling overwhelmed, perhaps in school, in your work environment, in your home life or maybe in your personal relationship. You have lost your foothold and unable to keep up with the demands of your daily life',
  Driving: 'your life journey and your path in life. The dream is telling of how you are moving and navigating through life. If you are driving and cannot see the road ahead of you, then it indicates that you do not know where you are headed in life and what you really want to do with yourself. You are lacking direction and goals. Similarly, to dream that you are driving at night suggests that you are unsure of where you are headed in life. You are experiencing obstacles toward your goals. Perhaps you do not want to see what is ahead for you or you are afraid to confront certain issues. You may be feeling apprehensive about the future. If your view is blocked or obstructed while you are driving, then it symbolizes your lacking awareness of something in your life. You are overlooking certain aspects in your life. Alternatively, the dream indicates dangers or problems that are not yet made known to you. If you are driving on a curvy road, then it indicates that you are having difficulties in achieving your goals and accepting the changes associated with it. If you are driving in the snow, then it means that you need to be extra cautious about how your approach your goals. Metaphorically, driving a car in your dream is analogous to your sex life and sexual performance. Consider how you are driving and what kind of car you are driving and how it relates to your waking sex life. Or the dream may be a pun on your drive or ambition. To dream that someone else is driving you represents your dependence on the driver. You are not in control of your life and following the goals of others instead of your own.  If you are driving from the passenger side of a car, then it suggests that you are trying to gain control of the path that your life is taking. You are beginning to make your own decisions. If someone else is driving you from the passenger side, then it means that you are being misled into thinking that you are in power or that you are in full control.',
  Flying: 'you are flying with ease and are enjoying the scene and landscape below, then it suggests that you are in charge and on top of a situation. You have risen above something. Flying dreams and the ability to control your flight is representative of your own personal sense of power',
  Walking: 'a slow, but steady progress toward your goals. You are moving through life in a confident manner. Consider your destination. To dream that you have difficulties walking indicates that you are reluctant and hesitant in proceeding forward in some situation. You may also be trying to distance yourself from certain life experiences.  The difficulty in walking is a reflection of your current situation and the obstacles that you are experiencing.',
  Naked: 'you are also most vulnerable. There is absolutely nothing that you can hide behind. Thus the dream may parallel a waking situation where you feel helpless or where you have completely let your guard down. Perhaps you are in a relationship where you have opened yourself up at the risk of getting rejected',
